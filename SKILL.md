# Needs Assessment

Apply Maslow's hierarchy of needs to diagnose which level is most pressing for an individual, team, or organization.

---

## When to Use

- Someone describes feeling "stuck" or dissatisfied without clear cause
- A team is underperforming and you need to understand why
- Someone presents multiple problems and you need to prioritize
- Career or life decisions seem blocked
- Organizational morale issues need diagnosis
- User asks "What do I/we need?" or "Why isn't this working?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of the current state, symptoms, or concerns |
| context | No | Additional background (individual, team, organization) |
| recent_changes | No | Any significant changes that preceded the current state |

---

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Human needs are arranged in a hierarchy of **prepotency**—lower needs must be substantially (not perfectly) satisfied before higher needs fully emerge:

| Level | Need | Core Question | Indicators When Unmet |
|-------|------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Physiological** | Are basic survival needs met? | Exhaustion, sleep deprivation, health issues, inability to focus |
| 2 | **Safety** | Do you feel secure? | Anxiety, constant worry, fear, hypervigilance, inability to take risks |
| 3 | **Love/Belonging** | Are you connected? | Loneliness, isolation, feeling like an outsider, seeking validation |
| 4 | **Esteem** | Are you respected and competent? | Imposter syndrome, seeking external approval, inferiority, proving behaviors |
| 5 | **Self-Actualization** | Are you becoming who you can be? | Restlessness despite success, searching for meaning, "is this all there is?" |

**Important Nuances:**
- The hierarchy is not rigidly sequential—some people transcend lower needs temporarily
- "Substantially satisfied" is the threshold (80%+), not perfection
- Cultural and individual variations exist
- Higher needs can emerge before lower ones are fully met, but instability results

---

## The Assessment Process

### Step 1: Identify Symptoms

Map the presenting concerns:
- What is the person/team struggling with?
- What behaviors or feelings are present?
- What is conspicuously absent (energy, creativity, connection)?

### Step 2: Diagnose the Level

Work up the hierarchy until symptoms match:

**Level 1 (Physiological) - Check first:**
- Sleep deprivation, burnout, physical health issues?
- Working unsustainable hours?
- Basic ergonomics and physical environment?

**Level 2 (Safety) - If Level 1 is met:**
- Job security concerns?
- Psychological safety in the environment?
- Predictability and stability present?
- Fear of punishment, criticism, or failure?

**Level 3 (Love/Belonging) - If Levels 1-2 are met:**
- Part of a team or community?
- Feeling included and accepted?
- Meaningful relationships at work/home?
- Isolation or alienation?

**Level 4 (Esteem) - If Levels 1-3 are met:**
- Feeling competent and respected?
- Recognition for contributions?
- Confidence in abilities?
- Meaningful achievement?

**Level 5 (Self-Actualization) - If Levels 1-4 are met:**
- Expressing full potential?
- Meaningful work aligned with values?
- Creative expression?
- Becoming who one is capable of becoming?

### Step 3: Identify the Dominant Need

The **lowest unmet need** is the dominant need. This is where intervention should begin.

**Key Insight:** Addressing Level 5 concerns when Level 2 needs are unmet will fail. Meet people where they are.

### Step 4: Recommend Level-Appropriate Action

| Level | Focus Intervention On |
|-------|----------------------|
| 1 | Rest, recovery, sustainable pace, basic needs |
| 2 | Security, clarity, stability, psychological safety |
| 3 | Connection, inclusion, belonging, team building |
| 4 | Recognition, meaningful challenge, skill development |
| 5 | Purpose, creative expression, values alignment |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Needs Assessment

### Presenting Situation
[Summary of the situation described]

### Symptoms Observed
- [Symptom 1]
- [Symptom 2]
- [Symptom 3]

### Hierarchy Analysis

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Physiological | Met/Partially Met/Unmet | [specific evidence] |
| Safety | Met/Partially Met/Unmet | [specific evidence] |
| Love/Belonging | Met/Partially Met/Unmet | [specific evidence] |
| Esteem | Met/Partially Met/Unmet | [specific evidence] |
| Self-Actualization | Met/Partially Met/Unmet | [specific evidence] |

### Dominant Need Level
**[Level Name]** - [Explanation of why this is the priority]

### Recommended Focus
[Specific, actionable guidance for addressing the dominant need level]

### Once This Level Is Met
[Brief note on what becomes possible when this need is substantially satisfied]
```

## Constraints

- **Do not skip levels.** Always assess from Level 1 upward
- **Do not pathologize.** Unmet needs are human, not disorders
- **Acknowledge cultural context.** The hierarchy has Western bias; collectivist cultures may prioritize differently
- **Avoid perfectionism.** "Substantially satisfied" (80%+) is sufficient to move up
- **Respect complexity.** People can operate at multiple levels simultaneously

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My team is talented but can't seem to gel. We have good individual performers but team projects keep failing. Lots of politics and finger-pointing."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Needs Assessment

### Presenting Situation
A team of talented individual contributors struggles with collaboration. Good individual performance but team projects fail. Politics and blame are prevalent.

### Symptoms Observed
- Team projects fail despite individual competence
- Political behavior and finger-pointing
- Lack of cohesion despite talent
- Defensive rather than collaborative dynamics

### Hierarchy Analysis

| Level | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Physiological | Likely Met | No indication of exhaustion or basic need issues |
| Safety | Partially Met | **Finger-pointing suggests fear of blame; political behavior indicates unsafe environment** |
| Love/Belonging | Unmet | **Team cannot "gel"; no sense of shared identity or trust** |
| Esteem | Met individually | Strong individual performers who feel competent |
| Self-Actualization | Blocked | Cannot access due to lower unmet needs |

### Dominant Need Level
**Love/Belonging (Level 3)** - However, this is likely blocked by a **Safety (Level 2)** issue. The finger-pointing and politics suggest that psychological safety is compromised, which prevents genuine belonging from forming.

**Root Pattern:** Individual esteem is intact (Level 4), but Levels 2-3 are compromised. People protect themselves individually rather than belong collectively because it isn't safe to be vulnerable.

### Recommended Focus
1. **Address Safety First:** Establish psychological safety—make it safe to fail, admit mistakes, and ask for help. Leaders must model vulnerability and eliminate blame-based responses to failure.

2. **Then Build Belonging:** Only after safety is established can genuine team bonding occur. Team rituals, shared goals, and collaborative wins (not just individual recognition) build belonging.

3. **Restructure for Synergy:** Currently, individual good and team good are in conflict. Create conditions where helping the team helps the individual.

### Once This Level Is Met
With Safety and Belonging substantially satisfied, the team's individual talents can combine rather than compete. Team projects will succeed because collaboration becomes safe and rewarding rather than risky.
